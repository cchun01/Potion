## About Potion
Potion is a note taking platform aimed to help all types of people be organized and productive. We focused on taking a minialistic approach to allow users to work in a simple, yet aesthetically pleasing environment. Our platform allows users to create new notes, save them, update past notes, and delete notes that are no longer needed. Notes are very open ended, meaning that users can create lists, bullet points, paragraphs, and more. We built this application with the belief that organization and productivity should be easy. Potion is a flexible tool where you can store your notes in a simple way that suites you best.

## Linter
The Potion team is using the Prettier ESLint extension available in VSCode. (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint).
It uses the default Prettier ESLint code style. To install it on your own computer, download the Prettier ESLint extension in VSCode. Set it as the default formatter by opening a js file and pressing  CTRL + SHIFT + P (Windows/Linux) or CMD + SHIFT + P (macOS). Type "Format Document With" and click on "Configure Default Formatter" to change it to "Prettier ESLint."

## Axios
You will need axios installed on your computer if you download this code and would like to run it. Install axios by typing "npm i axios" in your command line under your project folder.
