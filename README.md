**Linter:**
The Potion team is using the Prettier ESLint extension available in VSCode. (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint).
It uses the default Prettier ESLint code style. To install it on your own computer, download the Prettier ESLint extension in VSCode. Set it as the default formatter by opening a js file and pressing  CTRL + SHIFT + P (Windows/Linux) or CMD + SHIFT + P (macOS). Type "Format Document With" and click on "Configure Default Formatter" to change it to "Prettier ESLint."

**Axios:**
You will need axios installed on your computer if you download this code and would like to run it. Install axios by typing "npm i axios" in your command line under your project folder.
